    <h1>Success!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for registering this Galaxy instance! In order to send data
        to GRT, you'll need to configure your Galaxy instance to support it.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        Download your configuration file to
<pre>curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: {{ object.id }}:{% if request.user in object.owners.all or auth_bypass %}{{ object.api_key }}{% endif %}' \
    https://telescope.galaxyproject.org/grt/api/conf.yml > $GALAXY/scripts/grt/grt.yml
</pre>
        Or copy and paste the below configuration:
<pre style="color: black; max-height: 10em">
{% include "api/grt.yml" %}
</pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
        Next you will need to configure this script to run as a cron job, every
        week. We recommend placing a script like the following in
        <code>/etc/cron.weekly</code>, and <code>chmod +x</code>ing it.
<pre style="color: black">
#!/bin/bash
cd $GALAXY &amp;&amp; python scripts/grt/export.py
</pre>
    You can run the script at any time and it will generate a directory of
    reports. These are not immediately uploaded to the Galactic Radio
    Telescope, this is done in a separate process:

<pre style="color: black">
#!/bin/bash
cd $GALAXY/ &amp;&amp; python scripts/grt/upload.py
</pre>

    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
        That's it! You're done. Every week the script will search through your
        Galaxy logs for jobs within the past week, and upload the data to GRT.
    </p>

            You might consider watching the <a href="https://github.com/erasche/galactic-radio-telescope">
            GRT repository</a> as the GRT is a very new project.
