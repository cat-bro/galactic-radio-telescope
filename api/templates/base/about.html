    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        As a Galaxy administrator, after talking to a number of other
        administrators, it was noticed that people ran Galaxy on highly
        heterogenous architecture. They would merge together clusters using
        Pulsar, they would add classrooms of computers with downtime hours into
        their HTCondor clusters, they would have a handful of nodes with
        terabytes of memory but long queue times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nearly all of the administrators had very simple methods for
        distributing jobs, often just "assembly jobs go to highmem". Some
        people even <a href="https://github.com/phac-nml/dynamic-tool-destination">
        wrote software to help handle the configuration</a> when administrators
        had more insight into their architecture and data.
    </p>
    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <h3>Anonymous Tool Run Data Repository</h3>
    <p>
        This service will provide an automated tool run information repository.
        Administrators will be able to enable a simple cron job, and publicly
        (anonymously) share run information. This will allow statisticians and
        analysts to work towards generalized tool run models.
    </p>
    <h3>Public Galaxy Directory</h3>
    <p>
        The GRT wishes to be a directory of Galaxy instances, accessible to end
        users. It should be a place where you can find a quick answer to "Who
        has my-obscure-tool" installed, and quickly find a suitable Galaxy
        instance for your analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>Dynamic Job Configuration Interface</h3>
    <p>
        With the results of analyses, we will develop a web based tool to aid
        in the configuration of dynamic job destinations, building upon the
        work of the <a href="https://github.com/phac-nml/dynamic-tool-destination">PHAC-NML</a>.
        The web frontend will allow you to generally specify your hardware, and
        download an appropriately configured <code>tool_destinations.yml</code>
        file.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Analysis Framework</h3>
    <p>
        Infrastructure permitting, we will integrate a Jupyter Notebook service
        which will allow statisticians, students, and administrators to easily
        analyse their data and the publicly available data. Once they've come
        to conclusions, if this component can be integrated, they will be able
        to post their results and the Galaxy Team will aggregate them into a
        coherent set of models.
