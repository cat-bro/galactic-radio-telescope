    <h1>Success!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for registering this Galaxy instance! In order to send data
        to GRT, you'll need to configure your Galaxy instance to support it.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        Make sure you're on a branch of Galaxy with the uploader script. TODO.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
        Next you will need to configure this script to run as a cron job, every
        week. We highly recommend placing a script like the following in
        <code>/etc/cron.weekly</code>, and <code>chmod +x</code>ing it.
<pre style="color: black">
#!/bin/bash
# Invocation is python grt.py galaxy.ini &lt;INSTANCE_ID&gt; &lt;API_KEY&gt;
python scripts/grt.py {{ object.uuid }} {% if object.owner == request.user %}{{ object.api_key }}{% endif %} -c config/galaxy.ini --grt-url {{ api_url }}
</pre>

    You can run the script with <code>--dry-run</code> beforehand, to see what data it will send.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
        That's it! You're done. Every week the script will search through your
        Galaxy logs for jobs within the past week, and upload the data to GRT.
