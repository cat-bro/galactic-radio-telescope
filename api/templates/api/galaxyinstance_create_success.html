    <h1>Success!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for registering this Galaxy instance! In order to send data
        to GRT, you'll need to configure your Galaxy instance to support it.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        Obtain a copy of <a href="https://github.com/erasche/galactic-radio-telescope/blob/master/client/grt.py">the uploader script</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
        Next you will need to configure this script to run as a cron job, every
        week. We highly recommend placing a script like the following in
        <code>/etc/cron.weekly</code>, and <code>chmod +x</code>ing it.
<pre style="color: black">
#!/bin/bash
# Invocation is python grt.py galaxy.ini &lt;INSTANCE_ID&gt; &lt;API_KEY&gt;
python /path/to/grt.py /path/to/galaxy/conf/galaxy.ini {{ object.uuid }} {% if object.owner == request.user %}{{ object.api_key }}{% endif %}
</pre>

    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
        That's it! You're done. Every week the script will search through your
        Galaxy logs for jobs within the past week, and upload the data to GRT.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <h4>Warning</h4>
        <p>
            You might consider subscribing to the <a href="https://github.com/erasche/galactic-radio-telescope">
            GRT repository</a> as the GRT is a very new project. For instance
            we have not yet selected an update mechanism, when we wish to
            change the GRT script.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Your Galaxy Instance</h2>
    <p>
        You can the see and correct the information associated with
        <a href="{% url 'galaxy-instance-detail' object.uuid %}">your Galaxy instance.</a>
    </p>
