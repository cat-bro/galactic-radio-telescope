    <h1>Success!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for registering this Galaxy instance! In order to send data
        to GRT, you'll need to configure your Galaxy instance to support it.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        Download your configuration file to
        <code>$GALAXY_ROOT/scripts/grt.yml</code>, and consider customising the
        tags and the location sharing feature, if you wish to opt-in.
<pre style="color: black">
galaxy_config: config/galaxy.ini
grt_server:
    ## URL to your GRT server
    grt_url: https://telescope.galaxyproject.org/api/v1/upload
    ## An instance ID uniquely identifies your Galaxy instance
    instance_id: "{{ object.uuid }}"
    ## An API key is required to submit data to GRT
    api_key: "{% if object.owner == request.user %}{{ object.api_key }}{% endif %}"

## The public name and description of your Galaxy instance
instance:
    ## The publicly accessible URL of your galaxy instance. E.g. https://fqdn/galaxy
    url: "{{ object.url }}"
    name: "{{ object.humanname }}"
    description: |
        {{ object.description }}
    tags:
        #- public
        - private
        ## If this is a cloudlaunch server, you could indicate that here
        #- cloudlaunch
        ## If you wish to share what infrastucture you're running on, there are
        #tags for this:
        #- infra/aws
        #- infra/gcp
        #- infra/azure
        #- infra/other_cloud
        #- infra/private
        ## Additionally if you wish to share a bit about your job runners we
        #would be interested to hear who is using which runners.
        #- cluster/condor
        #- cluster/slurm

location:
    # If autodetect is set to true, then an attempt will be made to
    # automatically detect your location using a third party service
    # (http://ip-api.com, https://icanhazip.com).
    autodetect: false
    # If you still wish to share the location of your Galaxy server
    # (great for helping people find local resources for Galaxy)
    latitude: 0
    longitude: 0

  - __SET_METADATA__
  - upload1

    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
        Next you will need to configure this script to run as a cron job, every
        week. We highly recommend placing a script like the following in
        <code>/etc/cron.weekly</code>, and <code>chmod +x</code>ing it.
<pre style="color: black">
#!/bin/bash
python $GALAXY_ROOT/scripts/grt.py -c $GALAXY_ROOT/config/galaxy.ini
</pre>

    You can run the script with <code>--dry-run</code> beforehand, to see what data it will send.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
        That's it! You're done. Every week the script will search through your
        Galaxy logs for jobs within the past week, and upload the data to GRT.

            You might consider subscribing to the <a href="https://github.com/erasche/galactic-radio-telescope">
            GRT repository</a> as the GRT is a very new project.

    <h2>Your Galaxy Instance</h2>
    <p>
        You can the see and correct the information associated with
        <a href="{% url 'galaxy-instance-detail' object.uuid %}">your Galaxy instance.</a>
